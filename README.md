# tf_publisher_gui
Update Version of http://wiki.ros.org/tf_publisher_gui

## Description

The tf_publisher_gui is based on David Lu!!'s joint_state_publisher. and Martin Guenther.

I add some convenience feature for better usage.

Here is how it looks of my version:

## Features

- Select parent/child frame directly on the GUI
- Pre-load current TF when open GUI
- Reset current TF by "Load Default" butoon
- Display roll/pitch/yaw both in degree and radius
- Add +/- button for better tuning, default increment is 0.01m and 90 degree
- backward compatible with Martin's version
